# How to Truly "Excel" at Data Analysis and Visualization: An Introduction to the R Programming Language

## Welcome!

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

## Before you arrive

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

- A laptop with WiFi is required to fully participate in this interactive course.
- Please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account (or link it to one of your existing accounts) [here](https://rstudio.cloud/).
- Install the latest version of [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download).
- Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application).
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [AACC R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/KwxToYefigwYS9MP6).

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

Please make every effort to arrive to the course room 5-10 minutes early to confirm you can connect to the conference wifi, ensure your computer audio and video is set up, and get RStudio cloud up and running.

1. Course content will be pre-loaded into the RStudio Cloud instance, so we will cover how to access it at the beginning of the course
2. The content is available at [our course github page](https://github.com/pcmathias/AACC-2021-Introduction-to-R) and can be downloaded from there as well.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, _in the long term_, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private data. You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. 

This course content was developed by the following people:
  * Daniel Herman
  * [Stephan Kadauke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skadauke/)
